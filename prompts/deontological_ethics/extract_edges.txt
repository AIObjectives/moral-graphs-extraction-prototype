I have analyzed the transcript of an interview to extract some representations of the 
moral principles expressed by the interviewee. 

Here's what I got: 

{nodes_json}

I am now interested in representing this individual's principles as a knowledge graph where the nodes will represent different principles and with edges such as: 

* `leads to`: this edge could meand that one principles naturally leads to another
* `supports`: This edge could be used to represent the fact that one principles supports another principles. 
* `conflicts with`: This edge could be used to represent the fact that one principle conflicts with another. 
* `requires`: This edge could be used to represent the fact that one principle requires another principle in order to be achieved. 
* `similar to`: This edge could be used to represent the fact that two principles are similar to each other. 
* `opposite of`: This edge could be used to represent the fact that two principles are opposite of each other. 

Looking again at the interview transcript below which edges would you add to the graph, and can you include quotes from the original text suggesting that the edge should be there.

Please return the result as JSON objects
 
 { 
  "edgeType": "...", 
  "from": "principle1", 
  "to": "principle2", 
  "quotes": ["...", "..."], 
  explanation: ""
}
