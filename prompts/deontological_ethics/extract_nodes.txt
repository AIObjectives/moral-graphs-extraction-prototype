I'm an expert doing some academic research on Moral Learning and I'm interested in Deontological ethics. 

I will give you the transcript of an interview I want you to extract a set of "principles" (meaning: a set of moral rules or duties) which may be held by the interviewee, taken from the following lists of principles: 

{clean_list}

Examples of principles may be "do no arm", "tell the truth" or "obey the low".

For each principle considered relevant in the interview transcript, I want to come up with a score between 0 and 1 representing how strongly the interviewee might be adhering to the principle, and I also want to track the exact quotes from the transcripts suggesting that the interviewee believes in this principle.

Please return a list of principles along with scores and quotes, formatted as a JSON object of the form 

``` 
[
  {"principle": "...", 
  "score": 0.5, 
  "quotes": ["...", "...", "..."]},
  ...
]
```

Now here's the transcript:
