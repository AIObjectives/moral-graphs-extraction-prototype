I'm an expert doing some academic research on Moral Learning and I'm interested in Utilitarian ethics. 

I will give you the transcript of an interview I want you to extract a set of preferences or "values" that the individual interviewed believe are important to maximize happiness and minimize suffering.

{clean_list}

Examples of values may be "animal welfare", "environmental protection", "national security".

For each value considered relevant in the interview transcript, I want to come up with a score between 0 and 1 representing how strongly the interviewee might be adhering to the value, and I also want to track the exact quotes from the transcripts suggesting that the interviewee cares about this value.

Please return a list of values along with scores and quotes, formatted as a JSON object of the form 

``` 
[
  {"value": "...", 
  "score": 0.5, 
  "quotes": ["...", "...", "..."]},
  ...
]
```

Now here's the transcript:
