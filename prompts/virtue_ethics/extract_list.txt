I'm an expert doing some academic research on Moral Learning and I'm interested in Deontological ethics. 

I will give you the transcript of an interview I want you to extract a set of "virtues", meaning dispositions or character traits that the individual interviewed believes are important to develop.

Examples of virtues include: "honesty" or "courage".

I want you to return the result as a well-formatted JSON list of strings, where each string correspond to one virtues. Make sure to be very concise when formulating virtues. Don't hesitate to produce a long list, but try and only include virtues which are relatively general and not ultra-specific. 

Here's the transcript:
