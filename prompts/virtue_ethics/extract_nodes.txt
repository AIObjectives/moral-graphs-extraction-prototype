I'm an expert doing some academic research on Moral Learning and I'm interested in Virtue ethics. 

I will give you the transcript of an interview I want you to extract a set of "virtues", meaning dispositions or character traits that the individual interviewed believes are important to develop.

{clean_list}

Examples of virtues include: "honesty" or "courage".

For each virtue considered relevant in the interview transcript, I want to come up with a score between 0 and 1 representing how strongly the interviewee might be adhering to the virtue, and I also want to track the exact quotes from the transcripts suggesting that the interviewee cares about this virtue.

Please return a list of virtue along with scores and quotes, formatted as a JSON object of the form 

``` 
[
  {"virtue": "...", 
  "score": 0.5, 
  "quotes": ["...", "...", "..."]},
  ...
]
```

Now here's the transcript:
