We're still paying for the crimes that we allegedly committed. So even though they say you serve your time and you, you, you now supposed to be regaining your citizenship, but every time you fill out an application and they see that you are an ex-offender, they say, well, we don't hire ex-offenders.. Because we live in a society that capitalize on the ignorance of others. So they tell us, well, it is a criminal. This, this person has done this wrong and that person has done this wrong and, and they need to be locked away forever. But if somebody has done wrong and you call yourself a Christian society, then whether there's forgiveness come in at\n\n[00:00:55] I was already building the prison ministry. I've been doing this for years. I did it inside a prison and I'm doing it outside, but I worked for a school, I worked for Urban Prep Academy, which is an all black school, an all male black school.\n\n[00:01:10] And I worked there for six years as a counselor. I have a master's degree in communication. So one day one of the young men's parents came in and knew me from prison and he, you know, he spoke to me, hugged me, Hey man, man, what you doing here? And I, this is where I work at, man. They let you work in the school.\n\n[00:01:31] So I said, yeah, you know, I, he said, yeah, but you always was in the school getting your education, blah, blah, blah. So one of the secretaries overheard him and she was standing in the hallway. So she went back in the, and got on the computer. And when she got on the computer, apparently, cause I was on parole, she pulled up my record and she reported it to the CEO.\n\n[00:01:55] Now, I don't know that she done done this. So the CEO called me. Now, the principal already knew, . He say we got a red flag. So I said, well, what's the, what do you mean red flag? He said, well, it's apparent that you are an ex-offender. I said, yes. If you look at my application, it's on my application.\n\n[00:02:12] Then he started, well, how you get degree, what you, you was doing all this in prison and blah, blah. Yeah. Yeah. What you thought I did sit down and do nothing. I studied and went to school and worked every day. So he said, well, unfortunately, we going to have to let you go.\n\n[00:02:28] So the principal called me and this is what the principal said to me. He said, Mr. Muhammad, I'm not gonna say his name. He said, Mr. Muhammad, it finally appeared. He said, but because the effect that you had in this school on these young men, he said, I might let you go on paper, but you can still volunteer and I'll pay you under the table.\n\n[00:02:47] Not only was I effective six years, but I changed the whole paradigm of a school where they were having fights. They were doing all kind of stuff. These young brothers had so much respect for me because they understood what I came from. I knew how to communicate with them. I knew how to talk to them because I came out of the very same streets that they are in right now.\n\n[00:03:10] So if you came out of where they came from, you are more successful in reaching them as opposed to hollering and screaming at 'em. \n\n\n[00:03:17] Change_services_returning_citizens\n---\n\n[00:03:17] One of the things that has been challenging for me when I came home was, first of all, a job that was challenging, but Because I have degrees in various areas, I created a job for myself. That's what I do today. TRS Transforming Reentry Service Men and Women in Prison Ministry. This is a organization and a program that I have worked with our CEO and our director for many, many, many, many years.\n\n[00:03:47] it is important the resource directory. And it was developed by ex-offenders. And we developed that directory so that when men and women came out of prison and they pick up that book, everything that they need to know, every resource that they need to have access to is in that, what directory they can go to the directory.\n\n[00:04:07] And see, oh, okay, well I can find housing here. I can find jobs here. I can find healthcare here. I can find I need drug treatment. I can find that here. I need mental health treatment. I can find that here. Everything that they need has to be in the directory because once it's in the directory and those of us that work with the prisons, once we go into the prison, then the prisoners have access to what the directory.\n\n[00:04:35] So that means they have access now to the resources that are available for those that are coming home and even for those that remaining under those conditions of incarceration. Cause we can't forget them either. So it serves a twofold purpose. It connects that one that's still going to be there with life plus 50, 60 years, or four or five natural life sentences and things of this nature.\n\n[00:05:02] That person can help others while they're incarcerated \n\n\n[00:05:06] challenge_returning_citizen_resources\n---\n\n[00:05:06] I go to prisons all over the country,. And the challenge is\n\n[00:05:10] them having the resources that they need. When they come out, that's the number one challenge. Resources, because when they talk about where they can get a job here, how do they know that? Where's the resources at? Because I'm gonna tell you something, if we're not connected, if the men and women that are incarcerated are not connected to the society in which they're going to return to, then all of the organizations combined do them a disservice.\n\n[00:05:38] Why do they do 'em a disservice? Because they not connected to 'em. They don't know 'em. They don't have no way of knowing that you even exist \n\n\n[00:05:45] challenge_mental_health_prison\n---\n\n[00:05:45] don't even get to mental health? That's a whole nother issue because anybody that stays in a six by nine cell, a 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 years is suffering from post-traumatic prison disorder, not stress prison disorder.\n\n[00:06:02] That's what he's suffering from. That's what she's suffering from post-traumatic prison disorder, because prison is a unnatural circumstance. There's nothing natural about it, and as a result of being in that condition for 20 and 30 years, you suffer. Some psychological damage. So you have to have some spiritual guidance to keep you abreast or to keep you afloat.\n\n[00:06:26] Otherwise you'll be right back in there.\n\n\n[00:06:29] change_access_incarcerated\n---\n\n[00:06:29] To be able to have access. See, once we have access to those who are incarcerated, as well as those that's coming home, see, once you got access , to the prison population, Then you can provide that directory to everybody? Yes. So once they get out, every prison should have a what?\n\n[00:06:46] A pre reentry program that's preparing them anywhere from two to three years, preparing them to go home. That means connecting with the resources, getting actively involved. So we go into prison, talk to them, give them the directory, give them my, I give them my personal cell phone, emails, all of that.\n\n[00:07:07] They can call me. My phone constantly ringing \n\n[00:07:09] , if they fund us properly, see we, all of the people that work on our staff are ex-offenders. We only have two people that work with us that has not been formally incarcerated. Not only can we provide jobs for them, but we provide a platform to better serve those that are inside.\n\n[00:07:27] The reason that we hire ex-offenders is because ex-offenders know how to handle other ex-offenders. If you hire somebody, I don't master degree PhD college degree and they've never been there. Yeah. And they don't know how to handle this man or this woman who is suffering from a mental illness of post-traumatic prison disorder.\n\n[00:07:50] This person handles him like he handles the people in the street and creates a problem or a dilemma that may eventually get outta control or it turned into something else. \n\n[00:08:01] \n\n\n[00:08:01] win_job_returning_citizen \n---\n\n[00:08:01] I also worked for CTA, Chicago Transit Authority. They hired me as an ex-offender.\n\n[00:08:07] just before the new mayor came in, Just before election opened all city jobs to ex-offenders, to those that qualify all of them.? That's in government office and everything.\n\n[00:08:19] They opened all these jobs because you got men like myself, other men that I know personally that got degrees, master's degrees, bachelor's degrees, PhDs, \n\n[00:08:30] \n\n\n[00:08:30] challenge_education_prison\n---\n\n[00:08:30] When I went to prison in Illinois, it was different than it is now. Education was very available to you. You had access to all of that and some you even had access to trades. All of this was taken out of the Illinois Department of Corrections. Why? They don't have nothing. Now when I say nothing, nothing, you barely can get a GED.\n\n[00:08:51] So I spent a lot of my time in school educating myself first under my belief, and then getting the documentation that was necessary. So when I got out of prison, I knew what I would be faced with. So I spent, I spent 23 years there, almost 24 years there. I was always in school from day one. I stayed in school, got my master's degree, my bachelor's degree, my associate's arts degree in political science, because it's important for you to be educated, but it's also important for you to be able to understand yourself.\n\n[00:09:27] As a victim under the worst circumstances that if I could do it, anybody can do it. I told a guy this morning on the phone, don't just sit there and count the calendar, everything that they have to offer. Get it cause it's free, don't cost you nothing. So make them pay how you make them pay. Get educated.\n\n[00:09:43] Sure. They gonna laugh at you. Oh man, that old man. Look, he, man, get what you can get while you in there because once they take it away, as the systems is changing more and more, it's going to go to practice in slavery all over again. Because what does the 13th amendments say? It say slavery is abolished except that you're convicted of a crime.\n\n[00:10:05] So if they can keep that except. And put more and more people in there, then they can practice slavery all over again, whether you got an education or not. \n\n\n[00:10:14] challenge_mental_health_returning_citizen \n---\n\n[00:10:14] Let's talk about the mental health.\n\n[00:10:15] When, when a man or a woman comes from prison, what do resources do he or she have that can address his or her mental health? Or do you even think that he has or she has mental health? Remember he or she been gone for 30 years? Oh, they all right, so you sent him home and he or she goes to a home that has no order or stability, morals and principles are gone.\n\n[00:10:43] So when he comes out in an environment that has some sense of direction and order and he comes or she comes to a home and there's no order discipline, no structure, you put that person in that environment and tell and tell 'em now, okay, you can go live your life. How they don't know how they've been locked up 30 years.\n\n\n[00:11:04] Totally_new_world\n---\n\n[00:11:04] You come into a world that's totally new, that you've been separated from for 30 years. You don't know how to use a phone, you don't know how to use a computer.\n\n[00:11:14] You don't know how to use anything that will help you better your life because the things that you need in the world to survive in the prison, they keep these things from you. You don't need no computer. You don't need no cell phone. You go to get on the computer or the typewriter. Typewriters are outdated.\n\n[00:11:34] They still using typewriters in prison and this is 2023. We going on 2024. They still using typewriter. So the man and the woman that comes out of that environment is what? Alien to this world. They don't know what's going on. They have no clue. My best friend came home after serving 50, after doing 53 years.\n\n[00:11:57] When he went to prison, he went to prison in the sixties in 1966.\n\n[00:12:03] We was just together last weekend and he said, man, I love you bro. Cause you, you, you helped me so much. But he didn't, they didn't have cell phones when he got locked up. When I got locked up, that wasn't even around. We have to learn to use these devices and I'm gonna tell you, something funny. When I came home, my mother then was, we was driving and I seen the guy, he was, he was standing in the, where the bus stop at.\n\n[00:12:26] I said, man, he done went crazy. He talking to himself. My mama said no, he on his Bluetooth. I said, what kind of two , his teeth is blue.\n\n[00:12:34] She said his Bluetooth, she said that's the device that's in his ear and he can hear and he can talk on it. So I'm like, wow. So now as I'm riding, I'm thinking about this man, they got devices but you ain't even gotta touch the phone. And that, that stayed on my mind all the time. Then when I did get a phone, I had to do the most intelligent thing in the world.\n\n[00:12:56] And my mom, she laughed about it. She said, what are you doing? I said, I'm reading the manual. She said, really? She said, nobody does that. I said, well, that's the only way I'm gonna learn. I gotta read the book. Cause I'm a reading book. My mother was a school teacher for 30 years. So she forced us to read as when we were growing up.\n\n[00:13:15] So I read the manual, that's how I learned how to write use the phone, so those are some of the challenges that we face coming home not being, see, when you don't have access to modern technology, then you like a fish out of the water. \n\n\n[00:13:29] Marker\n---\n\n[00:13:29] When they arrested me and locked me up, I had no idea what was going on. Took me to court, tried me. No witnesses, no evidence, no nothing. Listen to this here. When they sentence you, they say, is it anything that you want to say? And I said to the judge, these are my words. I say, if there's a God and I believe it is, you gonna pay for what you've done for to me.\n\n[00:13:51] Cause you know I didn't do nothing but you sending me to prison because I won't give you no money. Take him away. Seven years later, I'm in the prison. You know how they do the news story before they bring on the story?\n\n[00:14:04] They show the little captioning. I seen the judge. I said, man, I, I need to see what's going on. So I got in there and I listened. My judge. His name is Thomas J Maloney. They was arresting him and he went to jail. For what? Bribery. And blackmailed.\n\n[00:14:21] And he went to prison and he died in prison. But I'm, that's why I'm so thankful for spiritual growth and development. I'm so glad for the teachings of the honorable Elijah Muhammad and the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan because they taught me how to overcome these conditions and not be bitter, not be angry.\n\n[00:14:41] Take your anger out in another way. I take my anger out by doing this work because this work is a healing for me. This how I heal every day. Cause I do the work every day.\n\n\n[00:14:51] Marker\n---\n\n[00:14:51] I believe that there's no human being. That cannot be redeemed. All of us can be redeemed. Mm-hmm. You know, and if we apply the principles of the scripture, both Bible and Quran, we can save 90% of our people. Cause they, they just wanna reach out.\n\n[00:15:10] They just want some to know somebody care. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and once somebody understands that you love them, then their response to you is different. They don't respond aggressively. They respond with love. , if you were with me, when I go in these prisons and I go in these jails and I start talking to these brothers and we have a sit down.\n\n[00:15:32] They appreciate me taking the time out to come there because I don't, nobody pays me to do that. Yeah. I do that from my heart because I know what it's like not to get a letter. I know what it's like to see me and go every, every day to the stand up there for the mail call and nobody calls their name.\n\n[00:15:50] The most valuables thing in the world to a prisoner is a letter. It ain't a visit and it ain't money. It's a letter, a piece of paper just to say, I love you and I'm thinking about you. They'll read that 50,000 times. I've seen men read one piece of paper over and over again. It didn't happen, but a few words on it.\n\n[00:16:09] The visit comes and goes. The money comes and goes, but the letter. They'll take those letters and put 'em in an envelope and put 'em in a box. And whenever they release, they take those letters with them. They may leave everything, books, clothes, but they take them letters with 'em. Cause those letters are very valuable to them.\n\n[00:16:29] ​\n\n",

    "transcript": "Kimberly Woodson\nLink: https://vimeo.com/854538208\n===\n\n[00:00:00] . Hi, my name is Kimberly Woodson and I am a 53 year old mother of a five year old and a 35 year old.\n\n[00:00:07] And my biggest concern as a Detroiter is the gentrification that's going on. Like I can't ride down three blocks and it's now all of a sudden suburbanized and. It's little bitty kids that can play differently in a cleaner street and a different environment. And I feel like what happens to my little brown baby in the future, because I know as a youth growing up in Detroit, I wasn't heard.\n\n[00:00:40] It was like there was no protection for women and girls then, and it seemed to be no protection for women and girls now, like we just buried this baby all because her mother no longer wanted to be with a man in 2020. I had to bury my sister. Because she no longer wanted to be with her husband. It's an epidemic going on in society, and because most of the victims happen to be black and brown, it is not.\n\n[00:01:14] , don't get me wrong, I am forever grateful that during Covid 19, that man's life was lost, and the response to the death. I will ever be grateful for all the people, like the Black Lives Matter, everything that grew out of that one death.\n\n[00:01:33] It was like his name, a flood of . All these righteous, wonderful gifts\n\n\n[00:01:38] Marker\n---\n\n[00:01:38] Women, where is our righteous indignity? They lock up mothers. And when you lock up a mom, you destroy a community. When you lock up a dad, you don't need to destroy a household. So it's like where is the protection for the women that are incarcerated are, are there because of direct action of a man or a dominant co-defendant who was forcing things on them.\n\n[00:02:09] My fear is do I flee Detroit or Michigan because they don't see my baby? I. And they would never see her. Or do I stand and scream and shout and keep doing everything I feel is right, not for just myself and my daughter, but for my community. Do I still keep fighting to heal my community or do I throw in a towel and say, they're never gonna make me feel safe in Detroit because I'm not light enough.\n\n[00:02:40] Because I'm not the right ethnicity, you know what I'm saying? So it's like the same things can happen to the black and brown women for forever. And the first time it happens to someone of another race, then all hell loose. And that's not fair. And this is my city and it's been predominantly black most of my 53 years.\n\n[00:03:04] I'm sure it's been that way longer than that. So why is it that my resources, my cops, Can't come to my city block in a hurry like they do in all of the nice neighborhoods that they have now done since I've been home 2017. And when I first came home, I was devastated of my city, but now I see some improvement.\n\n[00:03:28] I love the idea of the walk and the bike ride to be able to go from one city all the way downtown to the river walk. I love to show off the best of my city, but there is parts and nooks and nannies of the family of the city that the mayor and everybody else don't want people to see and know about.\n\n[00:03:49] They need love too, and those are the spots that I care about the most. Those are the parts I do care about how my child is being educated in the Detroit public schools and their ratings. I do care about how people can want returning citizens to go show up to a Scared Straight thing to improve, prove they already feel bad, teenager or kids that's on a negative path behavior, but yet cannot allow a parent to volunteer and help.\n\n[00:04:20] Actually infiltrate and make sure that those children aren't making the same mistake that they made. So it's like you don't hear the little African American girl, you silence her everywhere you can. You don't try to begin to get her the help she needs and the minute she mess up, she's locked up. I fear for my daughter, I fear for her.\n\n\n[00:04:41] marker\n---\n\n[00:04:41] I want to leave Detroit like on the next thing. Smoking so bad. I can put the plan together. I'm outta here because I fear for my baby. I want her to go somewhere where she's just as included as everybody else that's around her. Do I have to go to a small hick town to do that? Where do I have to go that I feel like my African American baby girl will be seen, will be heard, and will be validated for all of her accomplishments and not have to work 10 times as hard as the other counterparts to see the same accomplishments and achievements and get the same rewards?\n\n[00:05:20] Can she be safe? Can she call the cops just like somebody else can call the cops and get the same response? Do I have to move in a richer neighborhood for her to be able to get help? If somebody's breaking in just as quick as somebody else can get help in other neighborhoods, that's not fair. Why is that?\n\n[00:05:39] And why is my taxes higher? Why is my insurance for my car higher? Why is my road the worst? I go in outstate. I drive around in outstate cities and I be like, Ooh, no bumps, no speed bumps. We definitely not in Detroit. That bothers me. Why is only certain parts of Detroit being beautified and the parts they care about the most?\n\n[00:06:03] To my people That my baby may have to grow up in here. Not being invested into my taxes. Pay just like everybody else's. .\n\n\n[00:06:11] Marker\n---\n\n[00:06:11] Domestic violence to me, like during covid 19. Everybody got to see the real people. The real monsters came out in the homes. People that was maybe able to go cheat with they girlfriends or whatever they was able to do, whatever extra release they was having was taking it all out on the people that was closest to them.\n\n[00:06:37] And domestic violence was on an all time high and. So many people got killed during them couple of years, and it was no outcry for that. There was no like, I feel like just like we raised the roof and kicked over things and got indignant for George Floyd's death. We should have been just outright and indignant and hitting the streets for the very first wife or domestic violence victim that got killed in they home because they was trapped in there.\n\n[00:07:14] Because the ' cause of Covid 19, it was like you have prosecutors , yes, domestic violence is on the rise, but yet, Nothing was being done. We were on a lockdown status. These people, the worst came out of the worst of people, and I feel there was so many lives lost that shouldn't have been lost, had society cared more, but because most of the victims.\n\n[00:07:39] Normally be black and brown females, they don't start caring until it's in their community. Just like even the doctor who got killed by her spouse in Oakland County, she only was spoken on for a few times, and I feel like she only got as much publicity as she did is because she was from Oakland County and she had a predominant position in the they district.\n\n[00:08:05] So, and that's only because had she just been another African American female, she wouldn't have got that much coverage. It would've been like a one liner, one story, and that's it.\n\n[00:08:16] And I feel like that's not fair because hurt people, hurt people. And sometimes when you're trapped in a situation, You need avenues to get out and we don't allow victims enough space to feel safe enough to trust us as a society to be transparent enough to say, I need help. I'm not going to look you in the face and say, I'm in a domestic violence situation and I don't trust you enough to do something other than talk about me behind my back.\n\n\n[00:08:48] Marker\n---\n\n[00:08:48] I feel mental health is the solution to every problem somebody has.\n\n[00:08:52] If you can think it through and you got to have a clear head, and you gotta know if your thinking is thinking or if you got on the right path of thinking. And in order to do that, sometimes you need a, a. Professional to help you just be a soundboard. They don't really have to offer your opinion. 'cause most people be like, oh, I got, do people think I'm crazy if I go see a shrink or do this?\n\n[00:09:15] No. You crazy to keep all that crazy. Thoughts that you not even sure you understand inside of you bottled up. It's gonna blow up one way or the other and the most unexpected time whatsoever. So you might as well try to get somebody that might be able to say, I've heard of something like this. Oh, you know, it's not that uncommon then you think.\n\n[00:09:39] You know what I'm saying? Or somebody to be able to say, you cuckoo with cocoa puff. Yeah. You need another opinion. But I'd rather for somebody to tell me I'm crazy. Than not have the opportunity to do that. For domestic violence victims, I feel mental health would allow them to get out of that space of low self-esteem shame and all the plethora of, of negative anecdotes that comes with being in that setting.\n\n[00:10:10] I think it would help them build enough confidence to do the self work that they need to come up out of that. Because you can remove a victim out of a situation, but if emotionally and mentally they still there, they gonna go back. I got to mentally and then emotionally prepare myself for the, for the exile before I actually make the exile, or I'm just gonna long for home again.\n\n[00:10:34] Mental health should be offered to the victim as well as those who abuse people. I often feel that if my brother-in-law had got help, Real counseling that he could have seen that his way of love was not conducive to the marriage and they could have worked out him having anger issues or insecurity issues or whatever.\n\n[00:11:00] 'cause I don't know exactly why it was he did what he did, and I'm not gonna pretend to predict it. I forgive him and I still love him and I, and it's not a day that go by that I don't wish I. That both of them was still here. And that's why I feel like mental health would have played, it would have saved my, their life.\n\n[00:11:21] It would've truly saved\n\n[00:11:23] their life. And. Even for like my family members, my loved ones, being able to seek counseling or probably save a whole lot of family. It's still a divide between the two families and it's gonna take everybody seeking.\n\n[00:11:43] Mental health work and working on your emotions and your mental and coming to a terms of proper grieving and it just, you, you gotta work. That's traumatic stuff you can't deal with on your own. And I think a lot of people feel like they're weak if they see their friend get killed and don't go talk to nobody.\n\n[00:12:07] That's not, most people don't see their friend get in front of them.\n\n\n[00:12:12] Marker\n---\n\n[00:12:12] You don't want to bottle yourself inside yourself because you worried about what somebody may think of you. They definitely gonna think the worst of you if you mess around and explode. They definitely gonna think the worst of you is you in the McDonald's line and the person behind you bumped you one too many times and you turn around and just start sticking them with your EpiPen and they end up dying.\n\n[00:12:38] And you wonder where did all that rage come from? Because you have so much bottle inside and you haven't talked to nobody and you haven't had an opportunity to release it because most people don't even do self care. So if you not doing mental health or self-care, you are a living, breathing, nuclear bomb waiting to go off, and you are going to destroy as many people around you when you explode that that you, you may not even want to, but you will destroy everything around you and it might just be the ones you love the most.\n\n[00:13:12] Do you really think some of these spouses said, I'm gonna wake up today and I'm gonna kill my spouse and kill myself. Something clicked in that moment. Something clicked and they said, this is it no more. I know for a fact when my brother-in-law killed my sister, he walked out the they was at the gas station.\n\n[00:13:31] I seen the video. He walked back to his car and he walked back to her car and on her and shot her. Something clicked in him. If he had intend on shooting her, he would've had the gun on him. When he was in her car, when he would've had it on him, he would've never sat in her car and talked if he was intend on killing her.\n\n[00:13:50] So something clicked and mental health could have stopped that clicking. Mental health could have got his mental back on track where he could have seen things in a different perspective because I'm sure he must have felt like it was the end of everything. He had to feel like, I can't go past this point and I'm not.\n\n[00:14:12] Okay. And we gotta get people to not go get to that point where they feel like they can't go past it. Because that's what suicides come in. That's what will people go off. And I'm just gonna have a a killing spree and I'm gonna try to make the cops kill me. ' cause they too afraid to kill they self. So yes, forget a stigma.\n\n[00:14:32] I don't want nobody, I don't wanna be the five o'clock news, so I'd rather go to the shrink and let them shrink my little head than be the five o'clock news. 'cause I didn't embarrass my whole family. \n\n\n[00:14:43] Marker\n---\n\n[00:14:43] Detroit public schools get the. Bottom of the resources. I feel like, and this have a lot to do with gerrymandering, prison gerrymandering, it's like when you lock up our residents from Detroit, when you go to any prison outta all the prisons in Michigan, the higher the largest population they're gonna have is gonna be from Wayne County.\n\n[00:15:04] In every prison, the largest amount of population is Wayne County. So if all of our residents is populating the, the prison system, when they do, they census, they count them in, like say for instance, Genesee County, or they count them in Ionia and that money and resources go to those schools. Mm-hmm. And it takes away from Detroit Public schools.\n\n[00:15:30] But however, the babies of the incarcerated individuals that's are locked up in MDOC are going to those schools. So it's like you setting them up for the prison and school pipeline. Now, because the schools are shitty, they don't get as many resources as all the other schools. You don't pay the teachers as much as they need to be paid.\n\n[00:15:53] And you. Cram their classrooms where they can't give our students as much of attention as they might need to excel to the best of their ability. And I feel like as suburban schools, the school ratio student to teacher ratio is not as bad. And the pay is better. And also the resources that the kids receive in those other suburban schools is much better than Detroit.\n\n[00:16:20] And also they grade is higher. When you get the grading system, they're higher. So what can we do to make Detroit schools just as higher? Why can't we pull all these resources to pull all Michigan schools up I don't care where I stayed in Michigan. I feel like my child should get a top A grade education no matter where I live, whether it's Flint, whether it's Jackson, whether it is Lansing or Detroit.\n\n[00:16:50] I want the same education level and I wanted to be the top grade. \n\n[00:16:54] \\ I want her to have as much of a advantage as she can. Course I feel like I have a very bright young baby and I don't care. I'm now, I'm not bragging 'cause it's my baby. Mm-hmm. But I feel like she's exceptionally bright and I don't feel like she's being challenging all the ways that she can learn.\n\n[00:17:12] . And I feel like other school districts. Incorporate more different styles of learning and because of lack of funding, I'm dyslexic and I learn differently, and I know it takes me longer to catch up to things since other people, but I catch it, but I also, maybe somehow I have to sing it to myself or I may have to see it, you know what I'm saying?\n\n[00:17:38] Or somebody may have to read it, you know, or maybe hands on. It's different things that I have to learn, different techniques, so everybody is not a one way. Type learning for every subject. And I feel like because of the budget restraints, the teachers aren't allowed enough liberty to be to explore different ways of reaching their students.\n\n[00:18:04] And even if they did, they don't have enough capacity to do that because they're overcrowded. And that would induce extra work, especially for Detroit. So I feel, I feel like if they have more resources, they can have more teachers or they can have a bigger school or something to be able to give every student the attention that they need.\n\n[00:18:24] Yeah. And not say because they were a little slow, put 'em in special ed because you don't have to be in special ed just because you need to sing it to yourself to catch it. \n\n\n[00:18:33] Marker\n---\n\n[00:18:33] Technology is not my best friend at all. I, it sucks. I suck. And technology, t technology sucks. Technology's supposed to make your life convenient. Well, they should tell that to people that has been in prison because I did almost 30 years and so I didn't have the advantage of growing up and like every new thing that advanced that you learned and it became like I have.\n\n[00:18:59] Three year olds that can do stuff better than me, and I got this wonderful job that I really enjoyed. I really love, love, love, and I'm going into that. When you tell somebody like, what's your weakness? I said, one of my biggest weaknesses was technology. Well, yet I still lost my job. Within months of being hired.\n\n[00:19:21] And matter of fact, weeks before Christmas I was without a job because of technology, and I had somebody actually sitting there beside me every step of the way of proving every step helping me. And it's sad because they don't think about that. It's like, It's like almost like why recidivism even exists at this point.\n\n[00:19:42] Because if you have somebody that's locked up for decades coming home and you don't give them no pre-training with any kind of technology, you are setting them up for failure. I'm good at what I do, but when it comes to inputting the things that I've done, I suck. It takes me longer to write a report.\n\n[00:20:00] For one, one-on-one that I'm having. Then it burst. I, I could have 10 one-on-ones in the time it take me to do one report for one, one-on-one, because that's how bad I suck at trying to put stuff in the computer. I'm always messing it up. After they get a new something, like I'm on my sixteenth phone since I've been home because, and it always be human error.\n\n[00:20:23] It never be like, maybe I've dropped a couple, two or three, but you know what I'm saying? Most of the time it was something that I did to the phone that was messed up and I had to get a replacement 'cause they couldn't fix it at the store. Like, we don't know what you did to this. \n\n\n[00:20:38] Marker\n---\n\n[00:20:38] But if we set up something in the Department of Corrections, it can be a dummy thing where it's only connected to like one database. Mm-hmm. Where they can like practice research and stuff. It can be like, we gonna hook this up to the legal library or something where they just practice.\n\n[00:20:59] Using like Google or researching stuff, \n\n[00:21:03] be able to have the technology at least six months in advance because you can't go over something one or two times and get it in. Like most of the applications, it's online. I had people that was like, I was ready to go, hit every spot. I had my pens ready, I was going to fill out, and they was like, go online.\n\n[00:21:25] Go online. And I was like, I don't even know what online is. You know, so it's like just even the terminology and the definitions will be awesome. . Something where it's a booklet or a free class that they can take upon leaving something that it can just be where we are investing in you because we know you're your future customers and we don't want you coming home not having a proper technology.\n\n",
