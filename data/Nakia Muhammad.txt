[00:00:00] challenge_returning_citizen; challenge_background_check
---

[00:00:00] one of the, one of my largest, challenges at this time is being a return a citizen and, the reintegration aspect into society.

[00:00:10] , you always hear, you do your time, you get an education, some skill set, a trade, et cetera, and you reintegrate yourself back into society. Well, legitimately, I'm in my third year at DeVry University working on my bachelor's for network management and communications. I have numerous.

[00:00:31] IT certifications from the bottom. just simple basic computer use, up upgrade and repair. And the highest certification that I currently hold is the Advanced Security practitioner,I've gone and gotten education. I've applied myself and yes, I have had some, opportunities in that field. But overall, as far as me actually getting my feet firmly planted and rooted in the IT arena, it's, it is a consistent thing of you're checking all the right boxes, you're answering the questions, absolutely correctly.

[00:01:08] But when we get to that background check aspect of things, I'm dead in the water and it's. It's disheartening, because for returning citizens and, , it's, it, it can become very disheartening for an individual who has completed their time and they're quote unquote doing the right things.

[00:01:30] But those results from doing the right thing. Aren't readily available or they aren't, it, it, it just doesn't happen. at least not the way that it, from my perspective, the way that it's presented on your channel 2, 4, 7, yes, we have all of these great programs and, these opportunities 

[00:01:48] sound good? And, and literally, I'm, I'm one of the ones like, if not for A Chance for Life, if not for some of the other community organizations that are out there, which is, is okay. But again, it is why should I, why should I be forced to have to depend on. Some organization who may or may not be able to help me. When you said, if I go and get the education and I apply myself and I do these things, then I can reintegrate myself into society.

[00:02:21] Well, a again, that's, it just doesn't happen like that. And, and that's a problem. And that needs to change. In some form now, how, how that change looks, because that, that actually ties into the recidivism rate. If you don't actu in actuality, give people opportunities to do and be better. When they had children.

[00:02:44] Myself, I have three children. My oldest is 28. I have a 14, 13 year old now. Dad has to take care and provide for these children. So when it come down to, I need gym shoes, I need sports uniforms, we got a field trip, et cetera, all of that take money.

[00:02:59] But if I'm not in a position to provide these things, and we just, that's just on school. Let's not even tie in anything else they want. I want this video game. I want to go to this concert. I want. Well, for me, at this point in I'm dead. I need to figure out how to provide these things. But if I don't have, and the IT field and cybersecurity, absolutely I should be in a much better position life-wise.

[00:03:27] if I was in a position that would allow for that. But I'm still in the paycheck to paycheck and struggling in a completely different field that. Has nothing to do with it. I'm, working in machining right now because that was all that was available for me. and even at that, it's a struggle. things just have to change in some way, shape, form, or fashion 

[00:03:50] there's nothing I can do about what happened in 1995, the one that I know that literally like red flag, like, yeah, I can't do anything about that. I've done 11 years for that and. 

[00:04:03] Like, yeah, I was 15, 16, and. at this point in life, yes, I did what I did, but now I'm trying to do something different


[00:04:12] change_background_check 
---

[00:04:12] , if organization, these companies don't change hiring practices and making the background check. so highly important if, if a qualified individual. Who may have, and, and I understand the background check is kind of important, but don't make it so heavily weighted just on background check. Don't get on TV and say, yes, we're gonna remove the check the box on your application, and.

[00:04:41] But you still do the background check and it's, the result is still the same. You just played slight a hand, more or less switching one thing for another. Yeah, we not going to check the box, but we still gonna do this background check. So it's, it's, things need to change in that regard. 


[00:04:56] change_returning_citizens_union
---

[00:04:56] What's holding back, returning citizens? Cuz I've, me and other people I've, I've talked to like, why isn't there a returning citizen's union or, or something of the like, because I, I hate it that it's again, that it happens to me that I gotta take wages that are way less than what I know I'm worth and take whatever job that I can get simply because of my background. some type of union that advocates like, okay, yeah, this person might be a return that says, but you gonna pay them a wage as if you know, or give them the opportunity for working.

[00:05:36] The same way you would give those opportunities to other individuals because it, again, debilitating being free and still feeling like you're in prison out here in society 


[00:05:47] challenge_mental_health
---

[00:05:47] mental health.

[00:05:48] another of the things that. It kind of has helped me, me understanding that particularly for black men, cuz it's something we don't like, mental health issues for us is I'm crazy as opposed to this is depression, anxiety, grief, et cetera. Those things are real and you have to approach them and deal with them.

[00:06:10] Otherwise they will negatively affect you, which led me to going and starting to talk to a therapist and, get counseling, et cetera, because I went through. Things I, I've lost key family members, my mother, my father-in-law, my mother-in-law, and my late wife, like back to back. And my thing was, okay, they're dead.

[00:06:32] There's absolutely nothing I can do about it. Yes, I, I feel a loss of them, but. At those moments in time when my supervisor, you don't want to take no time off of work. Why? It's not gonna change anything and I'm just gonna sit at home and it's going to bother me even more. So I need to keep moving at this point in life.

[00:06:52] I understand. Yeah. That grief. Needs to be addressed appropriately. Otherwise it will affect you negatively coming out later on. You can't just put, keep stuffing stuff in a box, keep stuffing it in a box and not addressing it and think that it's just gonna go away, or magically it just doesn't happen like that.

[00:07:15] But I had to go through processes to get to this point, to understand that fact that, oh, These things are real. A lot of other individuals who may have been to prison and when it's put out there that the, these programs and things geared to help them.

[00:07:32] The real fruition of those resources not coming through. That's another thing that adds on to, you know, why am I even trying? 


[00:07:41] change_technology_as_tool
---

[00:07:41] And you know, like with this whole IT thing and just bucket like, okay, mama. You might not like this computer, but you can't just go to your social security office and fill out a paper application. You gotta know how to use this thing.

[00:07:57] So they're gonna ask you for some documents. If you don't know how to scan and attach emails and up upload these documents, then you're locking yourself outta resources that's important to you. 

[00:08:10] Here in Detroit there's many things that this computer is not just for toy.

[00:08:15] it is not just for Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat playing Candy Crush or Diner Dash and all of that is fine, but. In this community, people really understand how much of a business tool that the computer is and can be. yeah. The reality of it sinking in and people knowing how to use it as a business tool or even your smartphone is not something that's, I guess, readily available if 

[00:08:44] people don't know what they don't know and they don't know what they need to know because they don't know. 


[00:08:51] challenge_credit
---

[00:08:51] another thing, credit and things of that nature and, and trying to get your credit score to a point where you can qualify for, Purchasing a home and assistance with down payment.

[00:09:02] And again, even at that, without the finances to do that, I don't care how good my credit score is. If I can't pay the mortgage that you're gonna approve me for, then it means nothing. , if you don't have the finances to keep up with the mortgage and taxes and things like that, then it is useless with it. All of these things are kind of intertwined.

[00:09:25] challenge_ politics
---

[00:09:25] there has to be changes across the board. well how does that look? Honestly, I don't know. I just know that it does, whether it's through, legislation, through company policy hiring practices, but something needs to change. The smoke and mirrors need to stop. I don't wanna sound negative. Well, It's a difference between just being negative and this is just a reality. What you, you don't wanna hear the truth. The truth is what it is. You might not like it, but hey, this is the reality of the situation that I, a lot of people, experience and, as was stated before, a lot of people just don't know how to address it or what outlets they have or what they can do about it, Legislation and things like that do need to change. And it shouldn't be an aspect of, . As a state representative, as a legislature, technically you work for me.

[00:10:24] Okay? you don't work for the lobbyists. 

[00:10:27] people don't know that. Yeah. They don't know how politics work. They don't know. And, and fortunately, unfortunately, I've, I've been in those rooms when some of those conversations are taking place and like, wow, it sound really good here, or on the other side of it.

[00:10:43] Election time, that whole pay to play. If you don't pay this organization or, or this lobbyist to endorse you as a candidate, then you're not elected and. With that particular candidate, an individual, all of these wonderful things that, yes, I want to lower taxes, or I wanna fix the roads, or I wanna do X, Y, or Z to garner the vote.

[00:11:09] But then when you are elected, Those things not happening. Most average individuals returning citizen or not, like, look, you do work for me. I can fire you and get you outta your office. If people actually collectively got together and wrote, petitions and things together, et cetera, to Yeah, you not doing your job, so you gotta go.

[00:11:32] Sorry. Mm-hmm. . You said you were gonna do X, Y, and Z. Okay, Mr. Senator, miss Representative, you got this amount of time to do what you said you were gonna do or me and the other a hundred thousand people who signed this petition need you gone. 


[00:11:49] challenge_child_education

[00:11:49] even with education.

[00:11:51] Those resources in Detroit versus where I was in, out Utica, Sterling Heights night and day. The, the resources in there, computer labs and things with, with my babies out there. Phenomenal here in the Detroit public school system, not so much. But again, it, those things that we've been talking about, the legislation and how they choose to,when they have these millages and that that data that everybody have to come to, to the school to get counted and mm-hmm.

[00:12:23] The way that things are done and, and the distribution of resources, it, it here in Detroit night and day and, and. Something needs to be done. How, how that happens. so what can we do about it?
