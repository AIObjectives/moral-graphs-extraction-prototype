[00:00:00] challenge_mental_health_prison

[00:00:00] Recently I just engaged in mental health therapy myself. And even with good insurance, I've found that it's kind of tricky post or during Covid to find carriers that will.

[00:00:15] accept even good insurance, let alone Medicaid or let alone no insurance. In fact, our agency actually pays for some people to get mental health services because they couldn't get them any other way. So we literally come out of pocket to take care of them. This is complicated even further when you're talking about people who understand things like post-incarceration syndrome and what it is to have that kind of very specific and state sanctioned trauma.

[00:00:43] In the mix. And there are a few people who do that, or there are a few who claim to do it and even less that actually are able to do it. But I, I think partially it's, it's because people who are formerly incarcerated are an afterthought in most things. They're an afterthought, especially when you're talking about mental health services, because I think most people either feel.

[00:01:07] That we're beyond saving or that we wouldn't engage in services anyway. So they're not really marketed to us. They're not put out there in a way that most people would find it to be something appealing, which is one of the reasons why I've been sharing my journey very publicly so that people understand that it would be crazier.

[00:01:28] Yes, I'm using that word on purpose to not. Engage in some kind of services after 27 years than it is to do so, and sometimes it's just good to have somebody who's a kind of a blank slate who doesn't know you, who doesn't try to fill in the blanks to, to operate as a sounding board, if nothing else, to process some of the things that we've reshaped in our memory over all the years.

[00:01:55] I went in in 1993, 

[00:01:57] and I came ho home in 2020. January of 2020, 

[00:02:02] it also, it also threw me into the deep end of the pool when it came to technology.

[00:02:07] I was either gonna sink or swim, so I started learning a lot of things and I found out that the undo button was my best friend. And that there weren't very many mistakes that I couldn't undo as long as I wasn't doing 'em on social media. Which I actually have a story about that too. My mom and I didn't talk for 17 years and I was peeping through the peep hole of Facebook looking at some of her stuff, and I'd started a page called Their Life Matters, and I thought I was liking something on her page with that, and it showed up as me and I didn't know how to undo a like.

[00:02:39] So I panicked for three hours until I picked my wife up from work and she could tell me how to undo it. And it happened to be on my 50th birthday. And when I came home, my mom had said, happy birthday. And it started the, the, the, the journey to our reconciliation and So, , sometimes the worst thing you think that happens to you ends up being the best thing.

[00:03:02] But technology is a ch a challenge for anybody. If they go away for 10 years. Technology changes so much, let alone being gone for 27. Or we had a gentleman that came in last year who did 44. He went in in 78 and came out in 2022. And so, and, and then on, on top of it, they give, , things like Obama phones and stuff like that, which are better than nothing, but they don't work the way they're supposed to.

[00:03:28] So people learn how to operate things that don't operate the rest the way the rest of the world does. Which does . More damage than good. 

[00:03:37] , I started my reentry before I ever came home, 

[00:03:40] but I had, I had started on this path of how am I going to live my life before I got out here? So I was as prepared as you possibly could be. I mean, I hit the, the Secretary of State the day I got out because I wanted to start. The process as soon as possible. I went to the social security office the same day.

[00:04:02] I had saved some money cuz I'd actually stopped going to school. I'd gotten my associate's degree the year before and the money that I was applying towards that, I started saving. I'm blessed with, she wasn't my wife at the time, but she's my wife now.

[00:04:16] , Being aware of the fact that we were gonna probably need to be a two car family to, in order to really be successful. So I had a lot of things that a lot of people didn't, but part of the reason that I had them is, is because I anticipated them and I played my part in it, where people were willing to put money on my books, and buy things for me while I was incarcerated.

[00:04:37] I would always ask them to put them off to the side. And a perfect example, that's my mother-in-law's cookie money, she called it. Every time she wanted to buy cookies, she put the money in a jar for me. And those extra two years that I stayed in in prison, that I was supposed to be out for the total of almost four years of cookie money, put $700 in my pocket when I walked out the door.

[00:05:00] There were no programs available because everything had run. Pre-COVID a certain way and everything el everything shut down. So there really were no programs anymore. The world was scattering, trying to figure out how to do things, and I actually became more valuable to my parole officer than he was to me because I got a peer recovery coach job.

[00:05:23] And so I started becoming aware of a lot of resources that I funneled back to him so that he could share them with other people in our situation. 


[00:05:32] change_prison_invest
---

[00:05:32] One of the biggest things that if, as, as a taxpayer now, and I think all taxpayers should be upset with, is the fact that we don't invest. In the criminal justice sim system we spend there's a difference. And, and one of the perfect examples of that is, is the way the Department of Corrections is set up is, is it does very little to emulate the actual world that most people are gonna be released into.

[00:05:59] It's based on, well, it's based on a military model. Where you break 'em down and then you build them back up. But when budget cuts come, it doesn't cost anything to break people down. It costs a lot to build them back up. So those are the things that always go, but even worse, it's based on a abusive parenting model.

[00:06:16] And, and so you're talking about giving people allowances. You're talking about grounding them when they don't do what they're supposed to do. They don't really have any real budgetary lessons that are learned. They don't have any idea that the reason why they're making 17 cents an hour is because they're deferring all these other costs, and they could use all these.

[00:06:36] Things to actually teach people before they come home, but they don't . What they do is, is that they learn that they're not worth very much, they're not worth, , good food, good clothes, any of those things. So their sense of value becomes really diminished. And I think that's the biggest challenge that we face working with the people that we do at A Brighter Way.

[00:06:56] Getting them to understand that they're worth it. Getting them to understand that what, that we are investing in them because we believe they're gonna give something back to all of us and to society as a whole. We're not just giving them something, we're pulling something out of them that already exists.

[00:07:12] And I think that's a huge disservice. I, a lot of people will think that it's on purpose. I don't necessarily think it's that conscious and on purpose, but I also believe that the status quo requires people to be on the bottom and people to be on the top. And therefore it allows certain people to stay on the bottom and become the aggregate for everything else.

[00:07:31] I think that's the biggest thing is a sense of sense of purpose, a sense of value, of sense of. That they actually can be, there's stigmas and we talk about stigmas all the time, especially when we're talking about those that are imposed upon us. But the, the worst stigmas are the ones that we internalize and take with us everywhere.

[00:07:47] So nobody has to, nobody has to do it to us because we stop ourselves. Nobody's gonna give me this job because I have a felony. Nobody's gonna do this. And I think that's one of the things that peer led reentry has the ability to kind of dispel is. Three and a half years after my incarceration, I'm the executive director of a nonprofit organization.

[00:08:07] And so you can't tell me what you can't do. I've got nine felonies on my record. I did 27 straight. I had an a prefix that I did two years on. I've done a year and a after the county, 53 years old, and I have nearly 31 years of incarceration. So you can do these things. They just aren't easy. 


[00:08:26] challenge_returning_job
---

[00:08:26] Nobody seems to wanna take the chance on you. I always joke that I was 30 for 30 in interviews. When I, when I came home, everybody wanted to hire me and, and gave me the thumbs up. And then, and, and, and I was not dishonest about my incarceration. I was very honest about my incarceration. But then when they actually, , did the background check, they apparently didn't hear me properly cuz then they rescinded the offer.

[00:08:51] And it's kind of funny now because I'm, I'm the head of an organization that currently is up to about a $400,000 a year budget. And I couldn't get a job at. Blarney Castle Petroleum because I couldn't handle $50 in the till.


[00:09:08] win_show_up
---

[00:09:08] . I've been stubborn my entire life and I just used it in all the wrong ways. Once I came home, I used that stubbornness to my advantage and I just kept showing up.

[00:09:19] People could decide how they wanted to interact with me, but they couldn't decide how I was gonna interact with them. That was my responsibility in that. So I just kept showing up. I kept sharing my story. I kept listening to other people because I wanna stay. A lot of people try and distance themselves from the problem, try and distance themselves themselves from their incarceration and things like that.

[00:09:43] And I didn't want to, because I believe that I'm meant to be a voice, and so I need to stay close to these things. So, So I just kept showing up and a lot of times people would say, what are you gonna trying for that job? There's no way you're gonna get that job. It's above your pay grade.

[00:09:57] And I said, let them tell me no because they're the only ones that can tell me no. And so I got a couple jobs that people were like, you're crazy. There's no way you're gonna get it. This job actually came to me. When the previous executive director vacated the position, I had been visible enough with work with places like Nation Outside and Home of New Vision and just volunteering and going to some of these rallies and getting to know people that the person who started this organization knew of me, thought that I was a good fit, and he called up my supervisor at Home of New Vision and he said, do you think Adam is up for this job?

[00:10:34] My supervisor said Adam was built for this job. And 18 months later, we've quadrupled our staff, quadrupled our budgets and everybody's asking us what our secret sauce is.


[00:10:48] challenge_education_prison
---

[00:10:48] . One of the things is, is that the system often abuses things like that.

[00:10:52] And so they had a bunch of people going to class and they weren't walking out with degrees. They were walking around about out with a bunch of credits and sometimes that still is the case. And then it, they have to piecemeal find a way to actually, , get close to a degree, which they have to finish when they get out.

[00:11:09] But at least people had an opportunity, at least they had something that they were, , pouring themselves into that gave them an opportunity at a better life, , at some kind of an upward trajectory. And then I was there when they took them too. I didn't fully understand the impact of 'em until years later, and I wanted to go to college and I had to find a way to fund it.

[00:11:29] On my own, which is very difficult. You have to find organizations that will, I mean, schools that will work with you, where the credits will be transferable, where you can actually afford them. The, the system requires you to buy brand new books every time so you can't get used books. So, , a lot of my books were.

[00:11:49] $350 to, to do the actual class. I, I used to joke about this, but it's actually true that it's really a problem when it's easier to get ahold of pornography than it is to get ahold of textbooks. That shows how twisted the system is. 

[00:12:05] And then shortly before I came home, they started to do the second chance Pell Grants again.

[00:12:11] So they started to do pilot programs. And it changes things. People approach things differently. I mean, if you approach your incarceration as being a prisoner, that's what you're going to become if you get to approach it by being a student. That's what you become. So you have to give people these opportunities to kind of change their life, change their family's lives in some ways, and make it so it's actually useful.

[00:12:39] A lot of the, a lot of the stuff they give them, they like a lot of the degrees they do are entrepreneurial degrees. Those are nice in theory, except for one of your conditions of parole, is you must work for somebody else. So like many of the vocations, they're just, they're disjointed from reality.

[00:12:57] They need to be tied to it. And if we create situations where we've got peer led reentry and things like that, people can get degrees and go into fields that they actually want to do and they're actually motivated to do. And it's not purely for money. . 


[00:13:12] win_brighter_way
---

[00:13:12] Our organization's called A Brighter Way, and it was started by three individuals who were formally incarcerated and they realized that there had to be a better way of doing things than they were doing at the time. 2016, you were getting towards some of the end of the Zero tolerance era in, in the state of Michigan.

[00:13:29] And so they were sending people back for everything and even ghost. Violations. And so they started working on this idea that was based on a 70 times seven mentoring model out of Muskegon, which is a little bit faith-based. And then they pulled back a little bit on that. They had a little bit of an s u d focus and they were in, in resource, rich Washtenaw County.

[00:13:52] But they weren't really able to tap into a lot of the resources. I came into the position at a time where the resources were a little bit easier. We had some of the ARPA funding available to us, and so we've expanded on our mentoring model. We've actually gone away a little bit from mentoring to what we call navigation mentoring has this hierarchical intonation to it. And so what we're doing is, is we're helping to navigate systems that we've all previously navigated. So all the people in my office, except for one person, has been formerly incarcerated. Matter of fact, the shirt that I'm wearing that you see, the 27 on my shoulders.

[00:14:29] It says A Brighter Way. It's got my name on the back and it's got the number of years that I served. Everybody in the office has the same thing. So we've got somebody wearing a 44, somebody wearing a 29, somebody wearing a 20. We got over a hundred years of incarceration in our office, so we do. I hate the term, but there's not a better term.

[00:14:49] We do individualized wraparound services and I can't even explain fully what those are because until I meet the person, I can't decide what those things are. They're so individualized that it might include a cheeseburger. Cuz if I don't get a cheeseburger in you, then we can't talk about anything else.

[00:15:06] But we do do the basic things, housing, transportation. We help connect with education. We help to connect, connect with employment, but our model is not a recidivism model. Our model is a quality of life model. Because recidivism doesn't have anything to do with the human quality of life is a very humane way of looking at this issue.


[00:15:27] change_expand_brighter_way
---

[00:15:27] One of the things that we want to do is, is we want to Replicate this model. We don't wanna expand. We think one of the problems is, is when organizations start to expand to being regional and when they start expanding to be statewide, when they started out local they lose a lot of what they had and they try and.

[00:15:47] Impose one area's will and culture into another area, which doesn't always work. What we do believe is, is that our model is 75% transferable. So if we can convey that 75% to the other 83 counties around us that wanna do something very similar to a brighter way, then we can expand our reach without having to have our hands.

[00:16:12] On all of it. So that's kind of where the capacity issue comes in is we wanna help to build capacity in the state so that there are more people using the Nation Outside Trauma-Informed, Peer-led Reentry Model. , working with people in every county, it shouldn't matter where you live. , like they say all the time, it shouldn't matter your zip code on what resources are available to you.

[00:16:35] They should be available everywhere. 


[00:16:38] challenge_housing
---

[00:16:38] Housing is a, they might not have it officially anymore, but redlining still exists. There's no doubt about it. There's certain areas that people can get into.

[00:16:49] And other areas that they can't. My own experience , and, and again, I wanna preface this with the fact that I always do and I recognize the fact that I experienced these things as a white male in America, and that that does, , make a difference in a lot of areas. And still, I've had problems with housing.

[00:17:07] I'm not on my lease right now. My wife is on the lease. We tried to move into an apartment above. My mother-in-law who's 86 years old now, wants to stay at home and my wife had already been approved. And then they said, well, we just need Adam to, , fill out the paperwork to be an occupant. And within three hours we were all now no longer approved.

[00:17:29] And even if we came up with the money to pay six months in advance, they still wouldn't let us into the place purely because I was in prison. Because you gotta remember, I'm also executive director of a nonprofit organization.

[00:17:41] I have nearly an 800 credit score. And so there's nothing else that goes into this except for that. And, and it was, there was like no discussions afterwards. So these things happened on a pretty regular basis. I also, it's Detroit adjacent. I also, a Brighter Way is located in Washtenaw County, which is a much more well-to-do area than Detroit.

[00:18:05] The problem is you have Eastern Michigan and you have University of Michigan, so they've got a transient population that can always fill their housing. There's a glut of people and there's, there's a shortage. A of actual housing. So somebody who's formerly incarcerated trying to find housing in Washtenaw County is hit with two things.

[00:18:24] The excessive price and the fact that, that if they have a that's not true. If part of Ann Arbor actually has something on the books that says they can't use your incarceration against you on the front end. On the back end, they still can. And the only thing that they have to do if they decide to do that is they have to give you your application fee back

[00:18:49] but they still have the ability to do it. So Nation Outside is working on some stuff like that statewide to get that off the books too. But I mean, it's, it's, it's pretty regular. It's pretty regular. You expect it, especially with the bigger property owners. The only real way out of this in a lot of ways is home ownership.


[00:19:08] challenge_home_ownership
---

[00:19:08] And it's hard to get to home ownership if you haven't been able to get a rental history. If people aren't giving you a job. And if you're not having people that are helping to actually build your credit, and that's one of the things that, , we have some good partnerships, especially with a bank called Old National Bank, where they actually do training for our individuals.

[00:19:28] And if they start banking there, they start working so that hopefully within two years they can get a loan, they can, they can buy their own house and go from there. 


[00:19:37] change_home_ownership 
---

[00:19:37] And then some of them we're trying to actually inspire them to buy. Multi-unit dwellings so that then we can do both things where that they can own something and they can rent to somebody else who couldn't otherwise rent.


[00:19:51] challenge_returning_citizen
---

[00:19:51] I understand the concept of the best the best indicator of future behaviors, past behavior, but how far do you have to go into my past to, to think of the things I did? My crime in 1993, I had a realization in this last year that I've done far more good. I. I've done bad and I never thought I'd get to that point cuz I did a lot of bad.

[00:20:15] But it's, but it's not even close now. But people have, if they go far enough back into the past, I tell people this all the time, the only difference between me and you is that my worst, the worst things I've ever done are documented. Most of the wor worst things that most people have done have just ha taken place in the dark and only they know about 'em.

[00:20:36] Mine are there for public consumption and I own them. 


[00:20:40] change_prison_perspective
---

[00:20:40] when I was inside, I used to say the best classes took place when it had me, a staff member and a volunteer running the class, cuz all three of them have a different credibility.

[00:20:51] And I think the thing that's been, , kind of minimized is, is the credibility that we have. They always talk about the things that could go wrong. I don't see 'em shutting prisons down. When overdose rates go up, when there are no visits, we know exactly where the, where the substances are coming in, that we don't stop hiring corrections officers.

[00:21:10] But why is that always the answer when it comes to somebody who's been formerly incarcerated, oh, one of 'em screwed up. We can't do this anymore. It is the idea that people's racism and bigotry has to go somewhere in this society, unfortunately.

[00:21:28] And so they can call us convicts, they can call us felons,


[00:21:31] win_despite_system
---

[00:21:31] The key with a lot of that is the framing that that takes place despite. The system, not because of the system, cuz it's amazing to me how they will kick us in the teeth every chance they get and then try and take credit for us.

[00:21:45] When something goes well, it's like, you can't do both, , I did this, I did, that's the stubborn part. I did this despite you, I was not gonna become a statistic. And I, and, and I still refuse to. So I got off parole last year for the first time. It's the first time that I've been not been on parole.

[00:22:04] Probation or some form of incarceration since 1985. And I told my parole agent when I came out, you're gonna get to count me as a victory. And he did. 


[00:22:14] challenge_returning_job
---

[00:22:14] Especially when it comes to that region, it's been underserved for so long. It, it, it, it seems to be resource rich in some areas, but it's not ultimately resource rich if everybody's driving in that works there.

[00:22:28] A lot of these positions that are, that are meant for, , reentry and people who've returned need to be given to the people who live in the area because you get. A multiplier effect out of that. So you get the time that they're actually working at their job and you get the time while they're home.

[00:22:46] People get to see that. So I would just, I would just be aware of that, that it's not only the services that we're providing, but it's the job themselves and the upward mobility that it, that it, that it creates. That is hugely important. So this. Bullshit model of the nonprofits that it's a bunch of part-time positions because you can get three part-time positions for the cost of one full-time is garbage cuz you're forgetting the person at the front end of those services that needs to be served as well.


[00:23:20] challenge_returning_job
---

[00:23:20] It's a model that they've gotten used to, but especially when you're dealing with people who've already been exploited and don't understand the system. A lot of people, a lot of people will get hired and they think they're making decent money because they're getting.

[00:23:31] , they're, they're contracting so they're getting no taxes taken out of it so that they don't understand that. They don't even have the, the, the advantage of having an employer who would pay half of those social security taxes, half of those payroll taxes. Mm-hmm. Things like that. And then they've got this huge bill.

[00:23:49] At the end of the year, there's just so many, so many ways that people continue to be exploited, even when it doesn't appear that way. 


[00:23:56] win_returning_job
---

[00:23:56] One of the things that we're employing in our model is we're trying to do, we're trying to create a living wage. It's an entry level position. So in Michigan, $40,000 in insurance and stuff like that isn't bad.

[00:24:08] You can live on it even in Washtenaw County, barely in Washtenaw County. But you can, and we're trying to do that as opposed to, , creating three part-time positions, , for something like that because everybody who works for us is formerly incarcerated. And so we want them to have the better quality of life as well.

[00:24:27] And then hopefully, They build up some of their skills, they go on to other areas and as I say, infiltrate other systems. And then we make room for the next person, , who can kind of benefit, , from that position as well. 


[00:24:41] change_connection
---

[00:24:41] They say the opposite of addiction is, is, is connection.

[00:24:44] And I think that's, that's what we all need. We, when we have connection, anything else is possible. If we don't, I don't care how much of a lone wolf you are, there's something else that's going on inside of you because even a wolf wants to be a part of a pack. Yeah. So that's, that's going on. And if we're doing it with one another, it doesn't feel so heavy.


[00:25:04] win_brighter_way
---

[00:25:04] We work around the system as much as we have to. We're kind of organic, so we do, we're old school we'll mail flyers in to make sure that people know that we're that, that we exist. We monitor things. That's from the vocational village when people are coming home and whenever we see somebody coming home to our county, we reach into them.

[00:25:24] We do it by getting to know families in the communities that have people that are incarcerated cuz they know who's coming back out to the community. So, , it's all hands on deck. We do everything that we possibly can to reach in because I always say that if I, if I meet you before you come home, especially if it's like six months before you come home, then it becomes a relationship that you have with Adam.

[00:25:48] If I wait till three days after you become home. Come home, I just become another appointment. 


[00:25:55] challenge_returning_citizen
---

[00:25:55] , there are things on the books that say Those who are coming home and are on parole are not supposed to associate with other people who have criminal records, which is ridiculous because if you think about this, I don't know what school you graduated from, but I'm, I'm on the campus of Michigan State University right now, and I can only imagine what it would feel like for them to be an alumni of Michigan State University.

[00:26:17] Where everybody understands the campus life and things like that. And then as soon as they graduate, they get told, you can't associate with any Spartans anymore. All you can hang out with is wolverines 

[00:26:28] that's the ridiculousness of it. But it doesn't stop anything.
