[00:00:00] It's important that those that have no voice have a voice through us who have been victims of incarceration.

[00:00:07] And now we are free, but we only free to a certain degree. We're still paying for the crimes that we allegedly committed. So even though they say you serve your time and you, you, you now supposed to be regaining your citizenship, but every time you fill out an application and they see that you are an ex-offender, they say, well, we don't hire ex-offenders.. Because we live in a society that capitalize on the ignorance of others. So they tell us, well, it is a criminal. This, this person has done this wrong and that person has done this wrong and, and they need to be locked away forever. But if somebody has done wrong and you call yourself a Christian society, then whether there's forgiveness come in at

[00:00:55] I was already building the prison ministry. I've been doing this for years. I did it inside a prison and I'm doing it outside, but I worked for a school, I worked for Urban Prep Academy, which is an all black school, an all male black school.

[00:01:10] And I worked there for six years as a counselor. I have a master's degree in communication. So one day one of the young men's parents came in and knew me from prison and he, you know, he spoke to me, hugged me, Hey man, man, what you doing here? And I, this is where I work at, man. They let you work in the school.

[00:01:31] So I said, yeah, you know, I, he said, yeah, but you always was in the school getting your education, blah, blah, blah. So one of the secretaries overheard him and she was standing in the hallway. So she went back in the, and got on the computer. And when she got on the computer, apparently, cause I was on parole, she pulled up my record and she reported it to the CEO.

[00:01:55] Now, I don't know that she done done this. So the CEO called me. Now, the principal already knew, . He say we got a red flag. So I said, well, what's the, what do you mean red flag? He said, well, it's apparent that you are an ex-offender. I said, yes. If you look at my application, it's on my application.

[00:02:12] Then he started, well, how you get degree, what you, you was doing all this in prison and blah, blah. Yeah. Yeah. What you thought I did sit down and do nothing. I studied and went to school and worked every day. So he said, well, unfortunately, we going to have to let you go.

[00:02:28] So the principal called me and this is what the principal said to me. He said, Mr. Muhammad, I'm not gonna say his name. He said, Mr. Muhammad, it finally appeared. He said, but because the effect that you had in this school on these young men, he said, I might let you go on paper, but you can still volunteer and I'll pay you under the table.

[00:02:47] Not only was I effective six years, but I changed the whole paradigm of a school where they were having fights. They were doing all kind of stuff. These young brothers had so much respect for me because they understood what I came from. I knew how to communicate with them. I knew how to talk to them because I came out of the very same streets that they are in right now.

[00:03:10] So if you came out of where they came from, you are more successful in reaching them as opposed to hollering and screaming at 'em.

[00:03:17] One of the things that has been challenging for me when I came home was, first of all, a job that was challenging, but Because I have degrees in various areas, I created a job for myself. That's what I do today. TRS Transforming Reentry Service Men and Women in Prison Ministry. This is a organization and a program that I have worked with our CEO and our director for many, many, many, many years.

[00:03:47] it is important the resource directory. And it was developed by ex-offenders. And we developed that directory so that when men and women came out of prison and they pick up that book, everything that they need to know, every resource that they need to have access to is in that, what directory they can go to the directory.

[00:04:07] And see, oh, okay, well I can find housing here. I can find jobs here. I can find healthcare here. I can find I need drug treatment. I can find that here. I need mental health treatment. I can find that here. Everything that they need has to be in the directory because once it's in the directory and those of us that work with the prisons, once we go into the prison, then the prisoners have access to what the directory.

[00:04:35] So that means they have access now to the resources that are available for those that are coming home and even for those that remaining under those conditions of incarceration. Cause we can't forget them either. So it serves a twofold purpose. It connects that one that's still going to be there with life plus 50, 60 years, or four or five natural life sentences and things of this nature.

[00:05:02] That person can help others while they're incarcerated 


[00:05:06] challenge_returning_citizen_resources
---

[00:05:06] I go to prisons all over the country,. And the challenge is

[00:05:10] them having the resources that they need. When they come out, that's the number one challenge. Resources, because when they talk about where they can get a job here, how do they know that? Where's the resources at? Because I'm gonna tell you something, if we're not connected, if the men and women that are incarcerated are not connected to the society in which they're going to return to, then all of the organizations combined do them a disservice.

[00:05:38] Why do they do 'em a disservice? Because they not connected to 'em. They don't know 'em. They don't have no way of knowing that you even exist 


[00:05:45] challenge_mental_health_prison

[00:05:45] don't even get to mental health? That's a whole nother issue because anybody that stays in a six by nine cell, a 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 years is suffering from post-traumatic prison disorder, not stress prison disorder.

[00:06:02] That's what he's suffering from. That's what she's suffering from post-traumatic prison disorder, because prison is a unnatural circumstance. There's nothing natural about it, and as a result of being in that condition for 20 and 30 years, you suffer. Some psychological damage. So you have to have some spiritual guidance to keep you abreast or to keep you afloat.

[00:06:26] Otherwise you'll be right back in there.


[00:06:29] change_access_incarcerated
---

[00:06:29] To be able to have access. See, once we have access to those who are incarcerated, as well as those that's coming home, see, once you got access , to the prison population, Then you can provide that directory to everybody? Yes. So once they get out, every prison should have a what?

[00:06:46] A pre reentry program that's preparing them anywhere from two to three years, preparing them to go home. That means connecting with the resources, getting actively involved. So we go into prison, talk to them, give them the directory, give them my, I give them my personal cell phone, emails, all of that.

[00:07:07] They can call me. My phone constantly ringing 

[00:07:09] , if they fund us properly, see we, all of the people that work on our staff are ex-offenders. We only have two people that work with us that has not been formally incarcerated. Not only can we provide jobs for them, but we provide a platform to better serve those that are inside.

[00:07:27] The reason that we hire ex-offenders is because ex-offenders know how to handle other ex-offenders. If you hire somebody, I don't master degree PhD college degree and they've never been there. Yeah. And they don't know how to handle this man or this woman who is suffering from a mental illness of post-traumatic prison disorder.

[00:07:50] This person handles him like he handles the people in the street and creates a problem or a dilemma that may eventually get outta control or it turned into something else. 

[00:08:01]

[00:08:01] I also worked for CTA, Chicago Transit Authority. They hired me as an ex-offender.

[00:08:07] just before the new mayor came in, Just before election opened all city jobs to ex-offenders, to those that qualify all of them.? That's in government office and everything.

[00:08:19] They opened all these jobs because you got men like myself, other men that I know personally that got degrees, master's degrees, bachelor's degrees, PhDs, 

[00:08:30] 


[00:08:30] challenge_education_prison
---

[00:08:30] When I went to prison in Illinois, it was different than it is now. Education was very available to you. You had access to all of that and some you even had access to trades. All of this was taken out of the Illinois Department of Corrections. Why? They don't have nothing. Now when I say nothing, nothing, you barely can get a GED.

[00:08:51] So I spent a lot of my time in school educating myself first under my belief, and then getting the documentation that was necessary. So when I got out of prison, I knew what I would be faced with. So I spent, I spent 23 years there, almost 24 years there. I was always in school from day one. I stayed in school, got my master's degree, my bachelor's degree, my associate's arts degree in political science, because it's important for you to be educated, but it's also important for you to be able to understand yourself.

[00:09:27] As a victim under the worst circumstances that if I could do it, anybody can do it. I told a guy this morning on the phone, don't just sit there and count the calendar, everything that they have to offer. Get it cause it's free, don't cost you nothing. So make them pay how you make them pay. Get educated.

[00:09:43] Sure. They gonna laugh at you. Oh man, that old man. Look, he, man, get what you can get while you in there because once they take it away, as the systems is changing more and more, it's going to go to practice in slavery all over again. Because what does the 13th amendments say? It say slavery is abolished except that you're convicted of a crime.

[00:10:05] So if they can keep that except. And put more and more people in there, then they can practice slavery all over again, whether you got an education or not. 


[00:10:14] challenge_mental_health_returning_citizen

[00:10:14] Let's talk about the mental health.

[00:10:15] When, when a man or a woman comes from prison, what do resources do he or she have that can address his or her mental health? Or do you even think that he has or she has mental health? Remember he or she been gone for 30 years? Oh, they all right, so you sent him home and he or she goes to a home that has no order or stability, morals and principles are gone.

[00:10:43] So when he comes out in an environment that has some sense of direction and order and he comes or she comes to a home and there's no order discipline, no structure, you put that person in that environment and tell and tell 'em now, okay, you can go live your life. How they don't know how they've been locked up 30 years.


[00:11:04] Totally_new_world
---

[00:11:04] You come into a world that's totally new, that you've been separated from for 30 years. You don't know how to use a phone, you don't know how to use a computer.

[00:11:14] You don't know how to use anything that will help you better your life because the things that you need in the world to survive in the prison, they keep these things from you. You don't need no computer. You don't need no cell phone. You go to get on the computer or the typewriter. Typewriters are outdated.

[00:11:34] They still using typewriters in prison and this is 2023. We going on 2024. They still using typewriter. So the man and the woman that comes out of that environment is what? Alien to this world. They don't know what's going on. They have no clue. My best friend came home after serving 50, after doing 53 years.

[00:11:57] When he went to prison, he went to prison in the sixties in 1966.

[00:12:03] We was just together last weekend and he said, man, I love you bro. Cause you, you, you helped me so much. But he didn't, they didn't have cell phones when he got locked up. When I got locked up, that wasn't even around. We have to learn to use these devices and I'm gonna tell you, something funny. When I came home, my mother then was, we was driving and I seen the guy, he was, he was standing in the, where the bus stop at.

[00:12:26] I said, man, he done went crazy. He talking to himself. My mama said no, he on his Bluetooth. I said, what kind of two , his teeth is blue.

[00:12:34] She said his Bluetooth, she said that's the device that's in his ear and he can hear and he can talk on it. So I'm like, wow. So now as I'm riding, I'm thinking about this man, they got devices but you ain't even gotta touch the phone. And that, that stayed on my mind all the time. Then when I did get a phone, I had to do the most intelligent thing in the world.

[00:12:56] And my mom, she laughed about it. She said, what are you doing? I said, I'm reading the manual. She said, really? She said, nobody does that. I said, well, that's the only way I'm gonna learn. I gotta read the book. Cause I'm a reading book. My mother was a school teacher for 30 years. So she forced us to read as when we were growing up.

[00:13:15] So I read the manual, that's how I learned how to write use the phone, so those are some of the challenges that we face coming home not being, see, when you don't have access to modern technology, then you like a fish out of the water.

[00:13:29] When they arrested me and locked me up, I had no idea what was going on. Took me to court, tried me. No witnesses, no evidence, no nothing. Listen to this here. When they sentence you, they say, is it anything that you want to say? And I said to the judge, these are my words. I say, if there's a God and I believe it is, you gonna pay for what you've done for to me.

[00:13:51] Cause you know I didn't do nothing but you sending me to prison because I won't give you no money. Take him away. Seven years later, I'm in the prison. You know how they do the news story before they bring on the story?

[00:14:04] They show the little captioning. I seen the judge. I said, man, I, I need to see what's going on. So I got in there and I listened. My judge. His name is Thomas J Maloney. They was arresting him and he went to jail. For what? Bribery. And blackmailed.

[00:14:21] And he went to prison and he died in prison. But I'm, that's why I'm so thankful for spiritual growth and development. I'm so glad for the teachings of the honorable Elijah Muhammad and the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan because they taught me how to overcome these conditions and not be bitter, not be angry.

[00:14:41] Take your anger out in another way. I take my anger out by doing this work because this work is a healing for me. This how I heal every day. Cause I do the work every day.

[00:14:51] I believe that there's no human being. That cannot be redeemed. All of us can be redeemed. Mm-hmm. You know, and if we apply the principles of the scripture, both Bible and Quran, we can save 90% of our people. Cause they, they just wanna reach out.

[00:15:10] They just want some to know somebody care. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and once somebody understands that you love them, then their response to you is different. They don't respond aggressively. They respond with love. , if you were with me, when I go in these prisons and I go in these jails and I start talking to these brothers and we have a sit down.

[00:15:32] They appreciate me taking the time out to come there because I don't, nobody pays me to do that. Yeah. I do that from my heart because I know what it's like not to get a letter. I know what it's like to see me and go every, every day to the stand up there for the mail call and nobody calls their name.

[00:15:50] The most valuables thing in the world to a prisoner is a letter. It ain't a visit and it ain't money. It's a letter, a piece of paper just to say, I love you and I'm thinking about you. They'll read that 50,000 times. I've seen men read one piece of paper over and over again. It didn't happen, but a few words on it.

[00:16:09] The visit comes and goes. The money comes and goes, but the letter. They'll take those letters and put 'em in an envelope and put 'em in a box. And whenever they release, they take those letters with them. They may leave everything, books, clothes, but they take them letters with 'em. Cause those letters are very valuable to them.
